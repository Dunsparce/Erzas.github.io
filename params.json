This means that the parliament has not yet been rebelled against at this time. Henry wants everyone at the British threat convention to fight and rebel against the parliament.\r\n4)\t“No man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism” – patriotic\r\n“That is the lamp of experience” – wise and thoughtful\r\n“Give me liberty or give me death” – passionate\r\n“Gentleman may cry peace, peace but there is no peace” – angry\r\n5)\tSupinely - lying on the back, face or front upward.\r\nExtenuate – make (guilt or an offense) seem less serious or more forgivable.\r\nSupplicated – ask or beg for something earnestly or humbly.\r\nProstrated – lay oneself flat on the ground face downward, especially in reverence or submission.\r\nRemonstrated - make a forcefully reproachful protest.\r\n6)\tParagraph 1 –\r\n“No man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism” this is ethos because he is saying he is the most patriotic\r\nHe says he is a “very worthy gentleman.”  This is ethos because he is saying he is qualified to give his speech there.\r\n7)\tParagraph 2 –\r\n“It is natural for men to indulge in the illusions of hope.”  This is pathos because he is saying that they currently aren’t happy.  (Implied)  Inspiring enough to cause a rebellion.\r\n“Whatever anguish of my spirit it may cost.”  This is pathos because he is saying that they can have a better future even if they cost is high.  This goes for others as well.\r\n\tParagraph 3 -\r\n“That is the lamp of experience.”  He is saying that he is skilled after being around for a long time. This is an ethos appeal because experience is very respectable.\r\nHenry says Britain has no enemies.   This is a pathos appeal because he proves that Britain was trying to make its people submit to the parliament’s power.  This will anger anyone who values their own freedom.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nParagraph 4-\r\n“There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us.”  By saying this he is saying that they have God behind them backing up their revolution so they can’t lose.  That makes this an ethos or a pathos appeal because he is saying this is the side that God is on.  God is possibly the strongest ethos appeal of all because he is the main religious figure in all Christian or Christian related religions.  This is a great pathos appeal because the side that God is on is the side that everyone would want to fight for.\r\n“The war is inevitable and let it come.”  This is another pathos appeal.  If the war is inevitable then it will happen no matter what they do.  This inspires others to join his view and the war effort.  People will fight for a war that is unavoidable.\r\n\tParagraph 5-\r\n“The war is actually begun!”  This is a pathos appeal because people will want to join the rebellion if it has already started in the north.  It is best to rebel against the parliament before the rebellion is stopped because it is too small.  They needed every person they could get for the rebellion to succeed which is why non-rebelling citizens would want to help.\r\n“Give me liberty or give me death!”   This famous quote implies that a life without freedom is not a life worth living.  Patrick Henry would live after rebelling or die in the rebellion and he clearly wants others to do the same as him.  This makes this a pathos appeal.\r\n8)\tThis is an allusion because it references mythology.  He is saying that hope is like a siren from mythology because it will make people believe lies.  This is a logos appeal  because he is telling the people in the Virginia convention that England will not allow freedom without a fight.\r\n\r\n9)\tPatrick Henry says “the battle sir is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.”  This answers the question about who would fight in the rebellion.  This answers that question if anyone had it on their minds and acts as a kind of ethos appeal if they did because Patrick Henry appears to be prepared with an answer for any counter argument.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
