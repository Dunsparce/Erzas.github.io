<p>Trust in your b button!</p>

<p><strong>Tier list</strong></p>

<p>F tier - zss/shiek: easily zoneable by side b not solo viable.  Not recommended for non link mains.</p>

<p>B tier - All non projectile characters. Easily zoned.</p>

<P>S tier - Bayonetta because like link you press b after all your moves to shoot projectiles.</P>
<p>SS tier - Link: self explanatory... completely broken... solo viable...</p>

<p><strong>Strategy Guide</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bomb Tech</strong></p>

<p>So the think about link... right is you can tech your down b and you already used your up b you can tech your down b.  You can Di the tech to tech the stage faster or slower allowing for the mixups.  The best way to throw your opponent off after a wall tech is to dunk them and shout "NO DI."  If they have a problem with the tier list then they can play link too.</p>

<p><strong>True Combos</strong></p>

<p>So the thing about link right is that you can true-combo your down-b into your up-b, which actually is amazing, and kills someone. you can follow it up with teching your down-b</p>

<p>So the thing about link right is that Link has one of the greatest things when it comes to true combos. You can actually combo your abilities with BM. So, for example,  here's a true combo: jab 1 into "IM A LINK MAIN" into up smash "ITS 3 SMASHES IN ONE" immediately into an up air. there's no counterplay if the link is good enough. Its unpunishable.</p>

<p>Ian says "Link is memes"</p>
